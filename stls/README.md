# Drinkmachine STLs

In here are all the files you should need to print out a case for the drinkmachine, assuming you've used the same parts I have, or at least ones with the same dimensions.  The case is somewhat modular, so if you have different diameter tubes you could print out just those sections, same with pumps, plug, LCD, etc.

The LCD is worth noting that even if you have the same one I do, it was not square, hence the seemingly misaligned holes.  This was so the actual screen is straight when looking at it, so your mileage may vary.

The holes are a start of me exporting all the individual pieces that make up the case, so you can use them to build your own.  They were exported as solid objects so you can then import them and change them to a hole / negative space, whatever your design program calls it.

In misc, there is a test print that I used to make sure all the various connectors fit, and generally that my printer (ender-3) was calibrated correctly.
